## 🌳 Decision Tree from Scratch: Bank Customer Deposit Prediction

### Overview
A machine learning project implementing a complete Decision Tree Classifier from scratch in Python, predicting bank customer subscription to term deposits with statistical validation.

### The Challenge
Build an accurate, interpretable model while addressing Information Gain's bias toward high-cardinality features - a common pitfall in traditional decision trees.

### Technical Implementation
- **Custom Algorithm**: Built Decision Tree Classifier from ground up with recursive splitting logic
- **Modified Gain Ratio**: Implemented custom splitting criterion for unbiased feature selection
- **Feature Engineering**: Designed K-Means Clustering algorithm to discretize continuous variables (Age, Balance, Duration)
- **Statistical Pruning**: Applied Chi-Squared (χ²) pruning to prevent overfitting
- **Validation**: K-Fold Cross-Validation for robust performance evaluation
