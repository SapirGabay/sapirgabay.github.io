# 🌟 Project: Twitter Sentiment Classification

## Project Summary

This project demonstrates foundational Machine Learning workflow, advanced text analytics, and comparative model analysis, essential for my specialization in Intelligent Systems.

## 🎯 The Challenge (Challenge)

The goal was to build a robust sentiment classification system capable of processing and categorizing large volumes of unstructured social media text data (Twitter). This required mastering text preprocessing techniques and optimizing model performance.

## ⚙️ The Action (Action)

* **Modeling & Process:** The project was executed in two stages, covering **preprocessing, feature engineering, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), modeling, improvements, and evaluation.**
* **Data & Lexicon:** Used the `sentiment.csv` dataset and a separate `test.csv` for final evaluation, alongside **positive/negative lexicon files** for deeper sentiment analysis.
* **Tools:** Developed and tested multiple classification models (SVM, MLP, and Decision Trees), utilizing key Python libraries: **scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib.**
