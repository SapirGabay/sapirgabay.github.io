title: "Machine Learning: Twitter Sentiment Classification"

## ⭐ Twitter Sentiment Classification with Machine Learning

### Overview
A complete machine learning pipeline for analyzing sentiment in social media text, demonstrating end-to-end ML workflow from raw data to model comparison and evaluation.

### The Challenge
Build a sentiment classification system that accurately processes and categorizes unstructured Twitter text data while handling the complexities of social media language (slang, abbreviations, emojis).

### What I Built
- **Data Processing**: Cleaned and transformed raw Twitter text with custom preprocessing pipeline
- **Feature Engineering**: Integrated sentiment lexicons (positive/negative word lists) to enhance text representation
- **EDA & Insights**: Explored patterns in sentiment distribution and text characteristics
- **Model Comparison**: Trained and evaluated multiple classifiers (SVM, MLP, Decision Trees) to identify optimal approach
- **Validation**: Tested final models on separate test dataset for real-world performance assessment
