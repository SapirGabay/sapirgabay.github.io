# Sapir Gabay

## B.Sc. Industrial Engineering & Management | Solution Designer & Rapid Learner

### About Me

I'm Sapir, a final-year Industrial Engineering and Management student at Ben-Gurion University, specializing in Intelligent Systems (GPA 87).

I am driven by a passion for **continuous self-learning and hands-on problem-solving**. I love taking on a business challenge, figuring out the right technical solution, and connecting data-driven insights with strategic understanding.

My hands-on experience includes working with startups and investors at the university's entrepreneurship center, where I performed detailed analysis and due diligence on potential ventures.

As a rapid self-learner, I constantly seek out new tools and love building practical solutions—from core code projects and data analysis to setting up automation workflows.
